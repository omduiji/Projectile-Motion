# Projectile-Motion

You are asked to design an interactive visualization/simulation that represents the "Projectile Motion" as an educational experiment.

The user should be able to set the initial velocity and the projection angle and should be able to press a launch button, after that he should see the projectile motion with the path and the covered distance in X and Y directions displayed on the screen.
There should be, also, a reset-button that enables the user to re-adjust the angle and the speed and to try to launch again!

We are expecting a single HTML file that includes the necessary styles and scripts.

Feel free to use any appropriate style that suits the visualization.
